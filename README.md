# neuromorpho_neuron_type_classification

Use RNN to classify unstructured swc data.

For train and validate model:
```sh
python RECTREE_train.py
```

The data folder is too big to upload. I will upload it later. 

Or modify the dataset_dir parameter in RECTREE_train.py is also ok.

pip install -r requirements.txt in a virtual env functions the same as a yml.
