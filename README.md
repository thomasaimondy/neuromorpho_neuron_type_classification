# neuromorpho_neuron_type_classification

Use RNN to classify unstructured swc data.

Run RECTREE_train.py to train and evaluate the model.
The data folder is too big to upload. I will upload it later. or modify the dataset_dir parameter in RECTREE_train.py is also ok.
pip install -r requirements.txt in a virtual env functions the same as a yml.
